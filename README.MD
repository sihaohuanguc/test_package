There is nothing valuable in this repository. It's just for testing package installing. However, it contains most elements needed for a package (I guess) and you could have a try to install it for fun.

To search for useful info, go to [www.google.com]. We could also make words **bold**.

List something:

* One
* Two
* Three

# Download
To download the package. Type in the terminal the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sihaohuanguc/test_package.git
```
Then go to the folder with the `setup.py` file. And run
```bash
pip install .
```
Now you've installed the package. You could use it at any place of your account.

# Test the package
**There is no data, so there isn't a `test_data` folder.**

To test whether the package works well, you could try the following command
```bash
main1 -h
main1 -m happy
main1 -i a.txt -m very_happy -t 101
```
